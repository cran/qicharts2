\title{Bernoulli CUSUM chart for binary data (EXPERIMENTAL)}
\usage{
bchart(
  x,
  target,
  or = 2,
  limit = 3.5,
  title = "",
  ylab = "CUSUM",
  xlab = "Case #"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Logical, vector of successes and failures.}

\item{target}{Baseline risk (0-1) or number (>1) of last observation to end
baseline period.}

\item{or}{Positive odds ratio of minimal detectable change relative to
baseline risk.}

\item{limit}{Control limit.}

\item{title}{Chart title.}

\item{ylab}{Y axis label.}

\item{xlab}{X axis label.}
}
\value{
An object of class ggplot.
}
\description{
The Bernoulli CUSUM chart is useful for monitoring rare events data, e.g.
surgical site infections and other types of complications. Based on Neuburger
et al. (2017) \url{https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2016-005526}.
}
\details{
Note that the diagnostic properties of the Bernoulli CUSUM chart is highly
dependent on the choice of parameters, target, or and limit, and that these
parameters should be decided by people with a solid understanding of the
process at hand. The default parameters, or = 2 and limit = 3.5, should,
however, work for most processes where the baseline (target) level is about
1%-10%, and one wants to detect changes in the order of a doubling or a
halving of the event rate relative to the target.

\examples{
# Generate 1000 random successes and failures with success rate = 0.02
set.seed(1)
y <- rbinom(1000, 1, 0.02)

# Plot bchart assuming success rate = 0.01, OR = 2, control limits = +/- 3.5.
bchart(y, target = 0.01)

# Plot bchart of CABG mortality using the first 200 surgeries to estimate target.
bchart(cabg$death, target = 200)

# Plot bchart of CABG readmissions setting the control limits = +/-5.
bchart(cabg$readmission, target = 200, limit = 5)
